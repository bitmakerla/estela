# Contributing to ESTELA ðŸ•·
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible ðŸš€, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Use [Github Flow](https://github.com/bitmakerla/estela/actions), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Run the APIs tests before propose a pull request.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## How to make Pull Requests

We implemente a [Pull Request template](https://github.com/bitmakerla/estela/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md) that will be used in every request proposed. Just complete the template. 

### Don't forget to reference the issue that you are working on.

### Documentation updated
To keep **estela** documented make sure you comment every funcionality added if it's necessary. Write the comment above that funcionality

### Pull Request label

Label each request you made `bug | enhancement | documentation`. Even if you are first time contributor, label with `good first issues`

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/bitmakerla/estela/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) code formatter

* Run `black .` for style unification
