### Build and run locally

Install Bundler and Jekyll (if you haven't)
```
$ gem install bundler jekyll
```
Install the gems if it's the first time you build the project
```
$ bundle install
```
Then, build and run the site
```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
By default, the site runs in the [localhost](http://localhost:4000/) and is built in a new folder named `_site`.
