## Spiders ðŸ•·
A **Spider** is a class that defines a class with methods to scrape a website. A project can contain several **spiders**.
estela web contains components for the detail and list view of spiders per project. Creating spiders is not something manual
in the frontend, and must be done via [estela-cli](https://github.com/bitmakerla/estela-cli) by deploying a project. The project's spiders will then appear
in the graphical interface for the project.

## Jobs ðŸ“‚
A **Job** is an instance of an spider that will be run. The **job** records and stores the data extracted by the spider.
estela web contains components for the creation, detail, list view of jobs per spider, and list view of jobs per project.
