# estela Helm Chart variables Appendix

## Chart variables

These variables define general aspects of the deployment, they do not alter the behavior
of estela.

* _local_ (Required): Set this variable to `true` if estela is being deployed on local
  resources. Otherwise, set it to `false`.

* _hostIp_ (Required/Optional): This variable is required only if the above variable _local_ has 
  been set to `true`, this address is a reference to the host machine from minikube. 
  Find it by running:
  ```bash
  $ minikube ssh 'grep host.minikube.internal /etc/hosts | cut -f1'
  ```

* _registryHost_ (Required): The registry host where the images of the estela modules are 
  located. If a local registry is being used, this host is equal to the above variable
  _hostIp_, remember to add the port if you are using a local registry host: `<hostIp>:5001`.

* _nodeSelector_ (Optional): The name of the node on which estela will be installed in case
  the Kubernetes cluster has multiple nodes. Use the format `{ roles: NODE_ROLE_NAME }`.
  
## Cloud provider variables

These variables allow the clean deployment of estela and its resources using cloud providers.

  >  For dev a free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) deploy can be used to set a database, as mentioned on [Estela Resources Guide](./resources.html).
  >  Or a mongodb can be setup on a local cluster on a docker image.

* _<SPIDERDATA\_DB\_CONNECTION>_ (Required): The connection URL to your database instance.

* _<SPIDERDATA\_DB\_CERTIFICATE\_PATH>_ (Required): Path where the database certificate is
  located. This value will be taken into account if your connection requires a certificate.

* _<QUEUE\_PLATFORM>_ (Required): The queue platform used by estela.

* _<QUEUE\_PLATFORM\_LISTENERS>_ (Required): List of the queuing advertised hosts in a comma-separated style.

* _<QUEUE\_PLATFORM\_PORT>_ (Required): The port number of the aforementioned listeners.
