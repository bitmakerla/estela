You can use the `installation/check_requirements.sh` script to verify that all requirements have been met. For example, here is an example of a successful setup:
```bash
$ bash installation/check_requirements.sh 
docker version is correct: 20.10.14,
kubectl version is correct: v1.26.1
helm version is correct: v3.11.0+g472c573
yarn version is correct: 1.22.19
node version is correct: v18.0.0
python version is correct: 3.9.12
minikube version is correct: v1.28.0
```

{: .highlight }
> Please note that command line installation is a reference 
> and some requirements could be installed in other ways, such as using binaries. 

{: .highlight }
> To use the above command-line instructions on macOS you need to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

{: .note}
> estela runs on Linux-based and Unix-like operating systems. Still, you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux
> ([WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install){:target="_blank"}) if you are using Windows. 
> Note: The Windows installation has not yet been tested by our team.

---

For the rest of the installation, open a terminal in the _installation_ folder
of the cloned [estela repository](https://github.com/bitmakerla/estela){:target="_blank"}.

## Resources

All the named resources (except the _Document Oriented Database_ and the _SMTP Email Server_)
can be started locally by running this command in the  _installation_ folder:

```bash
$ make resources
```

If you want to start only some of the resources, modify the `RESOURCES` variable of the 
`Makefile`.

To allow the use of images stored in the local container registry, you need to
add the following line to the Docker daemon 
[config file](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon){:target="_blank"}.
Then, restart Docker.

```json
{
	...
	"insecure-registries" : [ "<HOST_IP>:5001" ]
	...
}
```
Here is an example on how the config file should look: 
```json
{
  "builder": {
    "gc": {
      "defaultKeepStorage": "20GB",
      "enabled": true
    }
  },
  "experimental": false,
  "features": {
    "buildkit": true
  },
  "insecure-registries": [
    "<HOST_IP>:5001"
  ]
}
```
Where _<HOST\_IP>_ is equal to the output of:

```bash
$ minikube ssh 'grep host.minikube.internal /etc/hosts | cut -f1'
```

Please refer to the 
[resources appendix]({% link estela/installation/resources.md %}){:target="_blank"}
for detailed information about the resources needed by Estela.

---

## Environment Variables
First, make a copy (in the _helm-chart_ directory) of 
[`values.yaml.example`](https://github.com/bitmakerla/estela/tree/main/installation/helm-chart/values.yaml.example){:target="_blank"}
and rename it to `values.yaml`. If you do not need to define an optional 
variable, fill its value with an empty string `""`.

Refer to the
[variables appendix]({% link estela/installation/helm-variables.md %}){:target="_blank"},
and complete the `helm-chart/values.yaml` file with the appropriate environment values.

{:% .note}
The values that should be used if the resources have been deployed locally are
commented in the `helm-chart/values.yaml.example` file.

---

## Helm Deployment

The images for all Estela modules must be built and uploaded to the Docker Container Registry prior to installing the Helm application.

If you are using a local registry, you can build and upload the images by running the 
following:

```bash
$ make images
```

The Helm deployment requires a release name and a namespace to identify the current version
of the installed application. By default, the values of these variables are `base` and 
`default`, respectively.

To proceed with the installation, perform the following steps:

* Install the Helm application by running:

   ```
   $ make install
   ```

* If you are using Minikube, you will need an external IP for the API Django service. 
  To obtain this, please run the following command in a new terminal:

  ```
  $ minikube tunnel
  ```

* Now, we will need to apply necessary settings for Estela to function properly. 
  This includes updating the application with the value of the Django service 
  external IP, performing migrations, and creating the needed Django superusers. 
  This can be done by running:

  ```
  $ make setup
  ```

* If you are using the local resources, specifically MinIO, you will need to create a 
  public bucket with the name specified in the 
  [_BUCKET\_NAME\_PROJECTS_]({% link estela/installation/helm-variables.md %}#registry){:target="_blank"}
  variable.
  * Go to the [web dashboard](http://localhost:9001){:target="_blank"} and log in using 
    the default credentials: `minioadmin : minioadmin`.
  * Then, [create a bucket](http://localhost:9001/buckets/add-bucket){:target="_blank"} 
	using the _BUCKET\_NAME\_PROJECTS_ value as the bucket name.
  * Finally, go to the [bucket's page](http://localhost:9001/buckets){:target="_blank"}, 
	click the _Manage_ button of the newly created bucket, and change the _Access Policy_
	to _public_.

* You can create a new superuser to manage and use estela by running:

  ```
  $ make createsuperuser
  ```

The estela application is now ready to use!

---

## Web Deployment

To build the estela web application, run:

```bash
$ make build-web
```

Then, execute the web application locally by running:

```bash
$ make run-web
```

Visit the [web application](http://localhost:3000/login){:target="_blank"} and start
creating projects!

{:% .note }
You can use the superuser credentials that you set with `make createsuperuser` to login to the [web application](http://localhost:3000/login).

## Uninstalling estela
{: .no_toc}

To uninstall estela, simply run:

```
$ make uninstall
```

---

## Final Notes
{: .no_toc}

If you have installed estela locally, you do not need to repeat all the steps every time 
you reboot your computer. Once the installation is complete, you can start the application 
and resources with:

```bash
$ make start
$ minikube tunnel # Run this in another terminal
```

And stop the application along with all the resources with:

```bash
$ make stop
```
