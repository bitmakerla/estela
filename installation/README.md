# estela Installation Guide

The installation can be divided into four parts:

1. Set the needed resources to run estela.
2. Set the environment variables to configure estela.
3. Deploy the estela modules with Helm.
4. Build and run the estela web application.

Currently, estela is a kubernetes application, but it can be installed on different 
architectures (soon).

To install estela, refer to our official 
[installation guide](https://estela.bitmaker.la/docs/estela/installation/main-guide.html).
