<h1 align="center">Queueing</h1>

The project uses a Kafka cluster as its scheduler to transport scraped items into the database. The script `consumer.py`
was created to perform the task of transporting items from Kafka to the database. For more information on this module
and how to set it up, please refer to our [official documentation](https://estela.bitmaker.la/docs/estela/queueing.html).
